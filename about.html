            It all started back in the MySpace days, when I first learned to
            customize my page using HTML and CSS. The thrill of seeing my
            changes come to life in the browser brought me such satisfaction. I
            may have even used my newfound skills for some mischievous deeds,
            like tweaking my grades in the devtools so my parents wouldn’t find
            out I got a C in class! Since then, I’ve worked in various
            industries—fashion, translation, and education—but I always found
            myself coming back to tech. Recently, I decided to take the leap and
            enroll in a certification program to refresh my knowledge and learn
            new skills. Now, I’m focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I
            plan to keep learning new technologies as I grow in the field. My
            goal is to bring to life websites that people love—sites that are
            not only visually stunning but also accessible and enjoyable to use.
            I’m excited to see where this journey in web development takes me
            and how I can contribute to the future of the industry.

        <div class="about-emma">
          <p>
            One of my greatest passions is spending time with my Mini Schnauzer,
            Emma! She’s the sweetest little girl who adores long walks on sunny
            days and never says no to treats. I’ve been a dog enthusiast since I
            was a kid, and now I even look after other dogs as a side job. Most
            days, my home is filled with pups, making it a lively and joyful
            place—pretty much what I imagine heaven looks like!
            <br />
            It brings me so much happiness to see Emma and the other dogs
            wagging their tails, jumping for treats, or waiting eagerly for me
            to throw a ball. While they definitely keep me on my toes, there’s
            nothing more satisfying than seeing them go home happy or watching
            them drift off to sleep after a fun-filled day.

          <p>
            I've always had a deep love for movies. Like many, I started with
            Disney classics, but I quickly gravitated toward the films of my
            favorite filmmaker, Tim Burton. I’ve always admired his storytelling
            and the quirky, whimsical style of his characters and filmmaking. As
            I’ve grown older, I’ve also developed an appreciation for the works
            of Vincent Price, finding myself drawn to gothic films.
            <br />
            There’s something beautifully haunting about the darkness in this
            genre that captivates me. It transports me to another world, and the
            feelings I experience at the end of a movie are truly indescribable.
