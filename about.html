      <h3>Dog Enthusiast</h3>

      <p>
        While studying web development, I also work as a dog sitter, which has been a dream come true. My love for dogs started in childhood, and now I get to care for different dogs every day. Although it can be overwhelming at times, the satisfaction I feel at the end of the day—whether it's seeing their tails wagging as they head home or watching them sleep peacefully after a full day of play—makes it all worth it.
<br>
        My ultimate goal is to find a career where I can combine my passion for dogs with my skills in web development, creating meaningful solutions that benefit both pets and their owners.

      <h3>Children's Artwork</h3>

      <p>
        In my free time, I love to relax by creating children's illustrations. I'm especially drawn to this type of art because it brings magic and creativity into children's lives. There's something special about the limitless possibilities—you can transform anything into any shape, size, or color. I enjoy designing characters that are as unique and diverse as I want, inspiring children to use their imaginations and see the world in new, creative ways.

      <h3>Film Fan</h3>
      <img class="film-fan" src="img/film.jpg" alt="movie camera">
      <p>
        I've loved watching films for as long as I can remember. It all started with Disney movies, which I watched on repeat until the VHS tapes wore out. Over time, my taste expanded, and I became a big fan of Tim Burton and Vincent Price. I've always been drawn to gothic films, captivated by their dark, mysterious atmosphere. There's something about the blend of eerie beauty and compelling storytelling in this genre that has always fascinated me.
